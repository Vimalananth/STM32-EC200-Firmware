# Pump Controller — Project Rules & Architecture

## IMPORTANT — AI Assistant Rules

1. **Do NOT make any code changes without explicit user approval.**
   Always explain what you plan to change and why, then wait for the user to say yes
   before editing any file. This includes platformio.ini, source files, headers,
   scripts, and any other project file.

2. **Do NOT change build flags without understanding hardware consequences.**
   Removing or adding flags like `-DFW_MIN_LOGS` can have side effects that are not
   obvious from the code alone (e.g., feedback loops through shared UART pins).

## System Overview

Remote pump controller using STM32G0 (master) + Quectel EC200U modem for cloud connectivity,
and STM32F103 Blue Pill (slave) for relay control + flow meter via LoRa.

---

## Hardware

### Master — 7semi STM32G0 board
- MCU: STM32G070KBT6
- Modem: Quectel EC200U (MQTT over LTE)
- LoRa: RYLR998 on USART3 (PB8=TX, PB9=RX) — address 1
- **CRITICAL: PB8 is shared between USART3 TX (→ RYLR998 RX) and Debug_Print output.
  NEVER remove `-DFW_MIN_LOGS` from platformio.ini. If Debug_Print is enabled, every
  log line feeds back into the RYLR998 RX as garbage AT commands, permanently scrambling
  the module until AT+RESET clears it. FW_MIN_LOGS must always be ON on master.**
- Project: `c:\Users\admin\Documents\PlatformIO\Projects\STM32_EC200`
- Linker: `STM32G070KBTX_APP.ld`
- Uses `--specs=nano.specs` → **NO float printf**, use integer arithmetic only

### Slave — Blue Pill STM32F103
- MCU: STM32F103C6T6 (genuine ST chip, IDCODE = 0x1ba01477)
- LoRa: RYLR998 on USART2 (PA2=TX, PA3=RX) — address 2
- Relay1: PB12, Relay2: PB13
- Flow meter: YF-DN50 on PB0 (EXTI0, rising edge, pull-up)
- Debug UART: USART1 PA9 TX at 115200
- LED: PC13 (active LOW)
- Project: `c:\Users\admin\Documents\PlatformIO\Projects\STM32_BluePill_LoRa`
- Linker: `STM32F103C6TX_FLASH.ld` — ORIGIN=0x08000000, LENGTH=32K
- Upload: ST-Link (upload_protocol = stlink), NO fix_cputapid.py
- Uses `--specs=nano.specs` → **NO float printf**, use integer arithmetic only

## Pump IDs & Firmware

| Pump ID | Relay | Device | Firmware file |
|---------|-------|--------|---------------|
| pump01  | relay1 | 7semi board site01 | firmware.bin (PUMP_ID="01") |
| pump02  | relay2 | 7semi board site01 | firmware.bin (PUMP_ID="01") |
| pump03  | relay1 | 7semi board site02 | firmware_test.bin (PUMP_ID="03") |
| pump04  | relay2 | 7semi board site02 | firmware_test.bin (PUMP_ID="03") |

- PUMP_ID defined in `include/modem.h`
- Default (repo) PUMP_ID = "03"
- Build pump01/02: change to "01", build → firmware.bin, restore to "03"
- Push to `_pumpstarter_sync` repo → Railway OTA picks up automatically

---

## Firebase Structure

```
pumps/{pumpId}/settings     ← user-saved settings (Flutter app writes, bridge reads)
pumps/{pumpId}/status       ← live device state (firmware writes via MQTT)
pumps/{deviceId}/slave_log  ← LoRa heartbeat log (master writes)
```

### slave_log fields
```json
{
  "event": "lora_hb",
  "r3": 0,        // relay3 state (-1=unknown, 0=OFF, 1=ON)
  "r4": 0,        // relay4 state
  "rssi": -21,    // LoRa RSSI (0 = no signal)
  "snr": 9,       // LoRa SNR
  "age_s": 5,     // seconds since last heartbeat received
  "fl": 43.6,     // flow rate L/min (formatted as integer: %lu.%lu)
  "tv": 150,      // total volume litres since last Blue Pill boot
  "ts": 1234567890000
}
```

---

## Flow Meter

- Model: YF-DN50
- Formula: `Hz = 0.2 × Q` (Q in L/min)
- K-factor: **12 pulses per litre**
- 1 pulse = 83.33 mL

### Blue Pill calculation (integer only, no floats)
```c
flow_lpm_x10   = pulses * 50U;           // pulses/sec × 5 L/min × 10
flow_total_ml += pulses * 1000U / 12U;   // 83.33 mL per pulse
```

### Heartbeat format sent by Blue Pill
```
S:R1:ON|R2:OFF|FL:12.5|TV:150
```
FL = L/min with 1 decimal, TV = total litres (integer)

### tv resets on Blue Pill power cycle (RAM variable, not persistent)

---

## LoRa Configuration

- Network ID: 18
- Master address: 1
- Slave address: 2
- Band: 865000000 (865 MHz)
- CRFOP: 15

### Commands (master → slave)
- `P1:ON` / `P1:OFF` — relay1
- `P2:ON` / `P2:OFF` — relay2
- `STATUS?` — request status

### Heartbeat (slave → master every 30 seconds)
- `S:R1:ON|R2:OFF|FL:0.0|TV:0`

## COM Ports (Dev Machine)

| Port | Device | Use |
|------|--------|-----|
| COM43 | STM32G0 debug UART | Watch firmware debug prints |
| COM46 | Quectel Modem Port | — |
| COM47 | Quectel AP Log Port | Internal modem debug (MBEDTLS logs) |
| COM50 | Quectel AT Port | Send AT commands manually |
| COM51 | Quectel USB Serial | — |

### Test LoRa via AT commands (COM50 at 115200):
```
AT+QMTPUBEX=0,1,0,0,"pump/03/cmd",13
{"relay1":1}
```

---

## MQTT Topics

| Topic | Direction | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `pump/{pumpId}/cmd` | App → device | Relay commands (relay1, relay2) |
| `pump/{pumpId}/status` | Device → Firebase | Live status (voltage, current, relay states) |
| `pump/{pumpId}/slave_log` | Device → Firebase | LoRa heartbeat data |
| `pump/{pumpId}/settings` | Bridge → device | Push settings to firmware |

---

## Firmware Watchdogs & Recovery

- **2-minute MQTT offline watchdog** — `NVIC_SystemReset()` if MQTT offline > 2 min
- **CFUN reinit** — modem reinitialized if MQTT reconnect fails repeatedly
- **AT&F on init** — clears EC200U NVRAM to restore SMS notifications
- **SMS reception** — works during MQTT offline periods (3 fixes applied)
- `mqtt_offline_since_ms` reset on CFUN reinit to avoid watchdog race

---

## Master UART Connections (STM32G0)

| UART | Pins | Connected to |
|------|------|-------------|
| USART1 | PA9=TX, PA10=RX | Quectel EC200U modem |
| USART3 | PB8=TX, PB9=RX | RYLR998 LoRa module |
| Debug  | — | Via Quectel AP log (COM47) or STM32 UART (COM43) |

---

## Settings Fields (pumps/{pumpId}/settings)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `ov` | float | Over-voltage threshold (V) — relay1 only |
| `uv` | float | Under-voltage threshold (V) — relay1 only |
| `pl` | float | Phase loss threshold (V) — relay1 only |
| `uv_rst` | int | UV/PL restart delay (seconds) |
| `dry_i` | float | Dry-run current threshold (A) |
| `dry_t` | int | Dry-run trip time (seconds) |
| `dry_en` | int | Dry-run protection enabled (0/1) |
| `start_t` | int | Startup delay (seconds) |
| `hp` | int | HP rating (5 or 75 for 7.5HP) |

---

## Critical Coding Rules

1. **NO float printf** — both STM32G0 and Blue Pill use `--specs=nano.specs`.
   Using `%.1f` or `%.0f` causes `.rodata` overflow (~4KB penalty).
   Always use integer formatting: `%lu.%lu` for decimals.

2. **Blue Pill linker at 0x08000000** — no bootloader needed. Do NOT set
   `SCB->VTOR` in main.c. Do NOT use fix_cputapid.py.

3. **PUMP_ID in modem.h** — always restore to "03" after building pump01/02.

4. **Integer-only flow math** — K=12 pulses/litre for YF-DN50.

5. **Bridge forwards full JSON** — no need to modify bridge when adding new
   fields to slave_log; it passes through the complete payload.

6. **LORA_OTA_DISABLED** — LoRa OTA is disabled in current firmware.

## Bridge (Railway)

- Node.js service subscribed to MQTT
- Forwards all MQTT messages to Firebase in real-time
- Source: `bridge/` directory
- No changes needed when adding new telemetry fields

---

## Flutter App

- Source: `flutter_app/lib/main.dart`
- Settings page uses real-time Firebase listener (`onValue`) for multi-device sync
- `_settingsSub` listens to `pumps/{pumpId}/settings`
- `_devSub` listens to `pumps/{deviceId}/status` (Active on device card)
- HP presets: 5HP (dry_i=3.0), 7.5HP (dry_i=4.5)

---

## OTA Firmware Update

- Repo: `_pumpstarter_sync` (separate git repo)
- firmware.bin → pump01/02 (PUMP_ID=01)
- firmware_test.bin → pump03/04 (PUMP_ID=03)
- Push to GitHub → Railway service picks up and serves via HTTP
- Blue Pill has no OTA (must flash via ST-Link physically)
